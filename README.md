- In 2016, while working as a Team Lead at Amazon, I noticed how overwhelmed we are with Excel sheets and legacy web apps.
- In 2017 I decided to start working on a unified data repo MVP, a dashboard of sorts, tailored to the needs of the employees of the EU operations.
  - Showing a Landing with the most frequently used data.
  - Extra components for various vehicle movements, safety, reports etc.
  - Separate ticketing / incident integration.
  - Ability to quickly switch to and see the status of other Amazon sites.
  - Being able to see currently on shift employees of the chosen site.
  - Accessible from mobile for senior management to reduce daily email reports and meetings even.
- Project was discontinued in 2018 due to lack of interest/support from senior management.

<em>To this date, this is my favourite project.</em>

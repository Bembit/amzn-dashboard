The project started in 2016 while I was a Team Leader, handling extensive Excel data from multiple sources. In 2016, the idea of a web-based dashboard emerged. The shift from Excel to web technologies began, resulting in a dynamic live JavaScript (React) demo in 2017.

The Dashboard project streamlines operations by centralising diverse data sources into a single platform. This user-friendly dashboard eliminates the need to search various websites, Excel sheets, and emails for crucial information, saving employee time and effort.

The main goal of the project is to boost productivity by providing a unified interface for data retrieval. By aggregating data from different sources, the dashboard empowers users to quickly access and analyse necessary information, enabling efficient task execution and decision making.

## Features:

- Centralised Repository: The dashboard acts as a hub, aggregating and organising data from various sources for consistent and accurate access.

- Intuitive Interface: Designed for easy navigation, the interface caters to users of all technical levels, facilitating hassle-free data retrieval.

- Real-time Updates: The dashboard offers real-time data updates, critical for swift decision-making in dynamic business environments.

- Search and Filters: Robust search and filter functions enable users to quickly locate information within the dataset.

- Mobile Access: The dashboard is accessible from various devices, allowing on-the-go information availability to reduce unnecessary laptop times.

- Contacts: The dashboard allows users to find the contacts of individuals from other operations within a few clicks.

- Read other Sites Data: Users can gain insights into the performance of other sites without the need for calls and emails, streamlining information gathering.
